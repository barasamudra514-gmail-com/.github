### **🎬 Plot & Theme (Rumored)**  
After four films of chaotic weddings and family madness, *Mahavatar Narsimha* might shift gears into a **globe-trotting spy adventure** where the core cast (Akshay Kumar, Riteish Deshmukh, etc.) accidentally get entangled in an international conspiracy. Think:  
- **Mission: Impossible meets Golmaal** – Mistaken identities, high-tech gadgets, and over-the-top action.  
- **A "Mahavatar Narsimha" of Spies** – The gang is wrongly identified as elite undercover agents, leading to hilarious yet dangerous missions.  
- **Villain Twist** – A powerful billionaire (possibly played by John Abraham or Bobby Deol in a negative role) is the mastermind behind a global threat.
